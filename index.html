               <p> I am a growing and an aspiring computer science student, wanting to major in Computer Science or Cybersecurity. I have always been curious with coding and exploring everything about computers and cybersecurity caught my eye. This curiousity started since 6th grade and has led me to do various projects on computer science outside of school. </p>
               <p> I also have a lot of other skills and interests, some include running in Track and Field and Cross Country. I have also always liked photoshopping and video editing. This was a very fun thing to do when I was a lot younger to pass time. But towards the end of middle school, programming and computer science is what got me really. </p>

            <p class = "sections__subtitle section__title--work">I have always wanted to learn from people who work at Google, SpaceX, or Nasa because of how interesting their types of work are, and I have only dreamed of getting an internship there. Other very interesting companies that I want to get an internship in are W2S Solutions, Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Intel, and Tesla. A internship through any of these companies would be very benefitial for me as it will give me a more hands on and intense experiance of how work is done in real life, as apposed to homework questions from school. I am also working very hard to do as many extracurriculars as I can like Hackathons and even teaching coding to kids around my neighborhood who are willing to learn. I am currently in Westwood High School, and I am also taking courses in Austin Community College to finish my college courses as soon as possible while maintaining a 4.0 GPA. </p>
